\title{Shortest paths distances between points on a planar network}
\usage{
dist_with_sims(pp, network, nsim)
}
\arguments{
\item{pp}{A sf point patterns}

\item{network}{A sf planar networks}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations generating randomly simulated points (must be > 1)}
}
\value{
A tibble of shortest paths
}
\description{
Computation of shortest path distances between all observed points of a planar network and
shortest paths distances between randomly simulated points on the same planar network.
Input point patterns data must be snapped on linear networks.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{Pi}/\code{P} points numbers in output tibble refer to initial order of rows in point patterns data.
\item \code{sim} column refers to the to the number of a specific simulation and the
\code{type} to the calculated distance depending on whether the points are simulated or observed.
}
}
\examples{
distances <- dist_with_sims(pp = liste_pp[[1]], network = liste_network[[1]], nsim = 5)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = distances, mapping = aes(x = dist_pi_p, color = type)) + 
geom_density()
